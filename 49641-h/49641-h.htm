</div>
<p>This smiling youngster in the chute of
a large whole body counter has just
emerged from the opening (beyond her
feet) of a hollow tank of scintillation
liquid, where she lay while the radioactivity
in her body was being &ldquo;counted.&rdquo;
In a minute she will step into her slippers
(on the ramp, right) and be ready
for play. The sensitive, heavily shielded
radiation-detecting equipment shown has
many uses that are described in this
booklet.</p>

<h1 title="">Whole Body Counters</h1>
<p class="tb">By JOHN H. WOODBURN
<br />and FREDERICK W. LENGEMANN</p>
<h2 id="c1">SENSITIVE DETECTORS</h2>
<p>Whole body counters are sensitive radiation detecting and
measuring instruments that provide information not easily
obtainable otherwise about that most important of all chemical
systems, the human body. They can do this because,
strange as it may seem, every person who ever lived is
slightly radioactive.</p>
<p>Quickly, accurately, and painlessly, whole body counters
reveal the kinds and amounts of radioactive substances that
have accumulated in the body from natural sources, from
man-made fallout, or from tracer isotopes given for medical
purposes. They count emissions from these radioactive
materials, as do other kinds of instruments known as
&ldquo;counters&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In contrast to devices that disclose concentrations of
radioactivity in a small area or a particular organ, whole
body counters usually are used to total up the burden of
radioactivity in all parts of a human body. They also are
distinguished from many radiation detecting instruments with
the same general purpose by their large size, their heavy
shielding, and their sensitivity to low levels of radioactivity.</p>
<p>Whole body counters are useful in many studies of physiological
activity in living persons and animals. They have
proved valuable in calculating the radiation absorbed by
victims of overexposure to radioactive materials. They can
show a doctor how much of his patient&rsquo;s body is fat and how
much lean. Whole body counters also gave medical scientists
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
clues to the relation of potassium deficiency to muscular
dystrophy and other diseases. And new medical and
scientific uses are being found regularly.</p>
<p>The need for an instrument that would measure whole
body radioactivity was first felt in the 1920s when the
hazardous nature of radium was recognized. Other sorts
of instruments had to be used to estimate the amount of
radium that some factory workers inadvertently had absorbed
while painting luminous watch dials with a radium-containing
coating. (See pages <a href="#Page_15">15</a> and <a href="#Page_16">16</a>.) But instruments
then available were without adequate shielding to eliminate
background radiation, and so the measurement efforts were
of limited value.</p>
<p>It was not until the 1950s that new types of radiation-detecting
instruments were designed, making use of the
discovery that some crystals, liquids, and plastics give off
light when struck by gamma rays (one form of radioactive
emission). Two principal types of instruments have been
developed to detect these emissions in human tissues.</p>
<p>The most common whole body counter employs a sodium
iodide crystal as the radiation detector. The person being
examined usually sits in a tilted chair in a room that has
thick steel walls to absorb background radiation. During
the counting period, the crystal is centered a few inches
above the subject. This type is useful for examination
involving low levels of radiation or emissions from more
than one kind of radioactive atom.</p>
<p>In the other type the subject is surrounded by a tank of a
liquid that detects gamma rays. This type is faster, but less
sensitive, than the crystal type.</p>
<p>This booklet is intended to enable you to make imaginary
visits to several whole body counters, to understand the
scientific principles that are applied in their design, to learn
the interesting ways they are used, and to appreciate the
promise they hold for increasing our knowledge of ourselves
and the world we live in.</p>
<h2 id="c2">THE GENEVA COUNTER</h2>
<p>In general, all whole body counters must have (1) a mechanism
that reacts to the energy emitted by some kinds of
disintegrating, or radioactive, atoms; (2) a device that displays
or records these reactions; and (3) adequate shielding

<p>One of the first whole body counters was shown at an
atomic science conference in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1955
(Figures <a href="#fig_1D">1D</a> and <a href="#fig_2">2</a>). While it was on display, 4258 visitors to
the meeting climbed a set of stairs to enter a 10-ton lead-walled
chamber. Here they stood still for 40 seconds while
the radioactive atoms in their bodies were being &ldquo;counted&rdquo;,
or recorded. This device, because it was the first one persons
could walk into, aroused great interest.</p>

<p class="caption small"><b>Figure 2</b> <i>How a &ldquo;walk-in&rdquo; whole body counter, such as the one demonstrated at Geneva, works.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Shielding for the Geneva counter consisted of 3 inches of
lead. Only the most energetic background gamma rays and
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
cosmic rays can penetrate this amount of shielding, and the
number that do so remain almost constant during successive
counting periods. This constant remaining &ldquo;background&rdquo;
radiation level, once determined, could be subtracted from
the recorded number of emissions to provide the correct
radiation total from the body of each person examined.</p>

<p class="caption small"><b>Figure 3</b> <i>Typical crystals and liquid materials used to produce scintillations for whole body counters and other radiation-detecting instruments. Scintillation counters provide much faster recording of radiation than Geiger counters, and are widely used in experiments with high-energy particle accelerators, as well as in whole body counters.</i></p>
</div>
<p>To detect the gamma rays emitted by radioactive atoms
disintegrating within the body, whole body counters take
advantage of a property of radiation that has been known
since 1896. In that year the English physicist William
Crookes discovered that X rays react with certain chemicals
to produce fluorescence. A few years later a New
Zealand-born physicist, Ernest Rutherford (later Lord
Rutherford), found that this glow consisted of many tiny
individual flashes or scintillations, each caused by the
emission of a single alpha particle. He laboriously counted
individual flashes by observing them through a magnifying
glass. If you examine a luminous watch with a hand lens in
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
a dark room, you can see these fascinating scintillations,
just as Rutherford saw them long ago.</p>
<p>Today, scientists have found several crystals, liquids, and
plastics that are especially effective in showing scintillations
caused by nuclear radiations. One of these substances,
with the challenging name 2,2&prime;-<i>p</i>-phenylene bis [5-phenyloxazole],
often shortened to POPOP, was used in the
scintillating liquid of the Geneva counter. How the flashes
are detected can be appreciated by considering the infinitely
small world of individual atoms and following a
single atom as it disintegrates. (For a more complete
explanation of radioactivity, see the companion booklet
<i>Our Atomic World</i> in this series.)</p>
<p>Let us assume that we are looking at a single potassium-40
atom in the body of the person to be examined and that it
is about to disintegrate. (Potassium-40 is naturally radioactive.
It is the most abundant radioisotope in our bodies.)
In any sizable portion of potassium-40, we know that half of
the atoms will disintegrate over a period of 1.3 billion
years, but, since this process is random, there is no way
for us to know when any particular atom will do so. However,
when it does, one of two alternative events will occur:
either a beta particle (that is, an electron) will be ejected
from the nucleus, creating an atom of nonradioactive
calcium-40, or the nucleus will capture one of its own
orbital electrons, resulting in creation of an atom of stable
argon-40 and the emission of a gamma ray. (The beta
emission process occurs in 89 out of every 100 disintegrations.
See <a href="#fig_4">Figure 4</a>.)</p>

<p class="caption small"><b>Figure 4</b> <i>Comparison of potassium-40 disintegration methods.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Assume that the particular gamma ray is traveling in the
direction of the scintillating liquid in the counter. Remember
that the gamma ray is tiny in comparison with an atom,
which is mostly empty space. Therefore, any one gamma
ray probably will miss all the material part of the atoms
in the body of the person being studied. Nor will it collide
with anything as it passes through his clothes and the stainless
steel tank. It also may fail to collide with any of the
atoms in the molecules of scintillation liquid, of course.
But let us assume that the one we are watching does make a
hit there. Its total energy will be converted instantaneously
to a flash of many bits or photons of light.</p>
<p>These photons radiate from the collision scene and strike
a light-sensitive surface in one or more of the counter&rsquo;s
photomultiplier tubes, which have been placed where they
can &ldquo;see&rdquo; the scintillation liquid. Energy transformations
result, and a tiny pulse of electricity is originated. These
photomultiplier devices are similar to the equipment in the
familiar &ldquo;electric eye&rdquo; door openers. As their name suggests,
photomultiplier tubes (see Figures <a href="#fig_6">6</a> and <a href="#fig_9">9</a>) do more
than merely respond to the light flashes produced in the
scintillation liquid. They also amplify the weak electron disturbances
into electrical pulses to operate meters that
record each scintillation and count the total.</p>
<p>The Geneva counter recorded about 25% of the total gamma
rays emitted by each subject. Since this sample was a constant
proportion of the total body radiation, it could be
converted to whole body measurements with about 97%
reliability.</p>
<p>In addition to finding persons with actual body contamination
among those counted at Geneva, the 1955 counter revealed
some interesting sideline information. People who
failed to remove radium-dial watches were soon spotted.
And one small boy who had picked up a sample of uranium
ore at a nearby exhibit &ldquo;jammed&rdquo; the instrument.</p>
<p>Each of the 25 persons who were found to have above-normal
levels of radiation could recall having worked with
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
radium or some other radioactive substance at some time in
the past.</p>
<h3 id="c3">THE LIQUID SCINTILLATION COUNTER</h3>
<p>A visit to this type of counter recalls the first glimmers
of scientific insight that the radiation in the human body
could be counted. In the early 1950s, Frederick Reines and
Clyde L. Cowan, two scientists at the Los Alamos Scientific
Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico, built a large liquid
scintillation counter hoping to prove or disprove that neutrinos
really existed. Neutrinos are elusive, uncharged particles
with essentially no mass. They had been predicted in
theory nearly 20 years earlier to explain how beta particles
of different energy levels can be emitted from atoms with
apparently identical nuclei.</p>
<p class="center b" id="fig_5"><b>Figure 5</b></p>

<img src="images/pmg013.jpg" alt="Figure 5, below" width="600" height="374" />
</div>
<p>According to theory, neutrinos are created whenever negative
beta-emitting atoms are produced. On this basis,
Drs. Reines and Cowan were convinced that the fission of
the nuclear fuel in the reactors of the Hanford atomic plant
at Richland, Washington, should create high densities of
neutrinos. They went to Hanford and set up an elegant neutrino-catching
experiment that hinged on detecting and counting
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
gamma rays of definite energy. To accomplish this, they
built a large liquid scintillation detector and shielded it from
stray gamma radiation. As their work progressed, someone
realized that the equipment was large enough to allow a
person to crawl inside. After further research at the
Atomic Energy Commission&rsquo;s Savannah River Plant in
South Carolina, they were successful in finding their long-sought
neutrino. In doing so, they also developed the sort of
instrument that can study the human body.</p>
<p><a href="#fig_6">Figure 6</a> shows a person about to enter one version of a
Los Alamos counter, the instrument&rsquo;s 140-gallon tank of
scintillation fluid, and 45 of its 108 photomultiplier tubes.
When the instrument is in use, the tank slides into, and is
shielded by, a 20-ton barrier of 5-inch lead.</p>

</div>
<p>The loading chute will hold a person 6 feet 4 inches tall
and weighing up to 260 pounds. The subject lies in the chute
as it slides into the counter. A lead plug behind his head
closes the end of the cylinder to add shielding. Counters of
this type have &ldquo;panic buttons&rdquo; with which subjects may
signal if they become uneasy on being confined. Most counts
are completed in less than 5 minutes, however, so the buttons
are rarely used.</p>
<p>Since the detector fluid almost completely surrounds the
subject when the chute is in place, this type of counter captures
twice as large a fraction of the emitted gamma rays
as does the Geneva type.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Each radioactive substance emits gamma rays with an
energy level characteristic of that substance. Whole body
counters are able to measure this specific energy spectrum,
or &ldquo;fingerprint&rdquo;, and so identify the kind of atom producing
the radiation.</p>
<p>The number of light photons produced in the scintillation
fluid is proportional to the energy transferred by the incoming
gamma rays. For example, gamma rays emitted by
potassium-40 have 1.46 million electron volts (Mev) energy;
those of cesium-137 have 0.660 Mev energy. When both these
radionuclides are producing flashes of light in the scintillation
fluid at once, the photomultiplier tubes produce two
different strengths of electrical pulses. Electronic devices
called multichannel pulse-height analyzers sort and record
the number of each.</p>
<h3 id="c4">POTASSIUM-40 IN HUMAN BODIES</h3>
<p>Data from whole body counters indicate that potassium-40
is the most abundant radionuclide in the human body. Our
bodies also contain other naturally radioactive substances
but the numbers of atoms usually present are so low (as
with radium for instance) that they cannot be detected with
whole body counters. Several man-made radionuclides also
have found their way into body tissues and organs in quantities
that sometimes are large enough to be detected and
counted.</p>
<p>Measurement of disintegrating potassium-40 atoms in the
tissues of a human body can be used to determine the total
amount of potassium (both radioactive and stable) in the
body. It is known that potassium-40 makes up 0.0119% of
all potassium and that 11% of all disintegrating potassium-40
atoms emit high-energy gamma rays that are measurable
by the counter.</p>
<p>The method of determining the amount of potassium in a
human subject is to compare the number of gamma rays
from a known amount of potassium placed in a phantom,
or dummy body, with the number counted from the human
subject (see <a href="#fig_7">photo on next page</a>). Phantoms are artificial
bodies, approximately the size, shape, and density of a
human body, used for calibrating counters. They are designed
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
so the radioisotopes they contain have similar
distribution to the distribution of the isotopes expected in
the real body. This is how a test might work:</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td class="l">Counts per minute from 140 grams of potassium in the phantom </td><td class="r">16,800</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Counts per minute with nothing in counter (background) </td><td class="r">12,000</td></tr>

<p>We can appreciate the sensitivity of whole body counters
by comparing the number of gamma rays recorded by the
instruments with the total number emitted from the body
being counted. The following data, also simplified, illustrate
this comparison:</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Fatty tissues are known to have a low potassium concentration
and muscle tissue a higher level. It is therefore
apparent that potassium-40 determinations provide a way
to indicate the amount of lean muscle in any individual,
and indirectly the amount of fat. Estimates of the amount of
fat based on the measurement of the specific gravity of the
subject, often used in the past, have never been satisfactory.
Not only do variable and unmeasurable air spaces change
body density, but the process of submerging a person in a
tank&mdash;to determine his specific gravity by the amount of
water he displaces&mdash;is a clumsy and uncomfortable one.</p>
<p>Significant variations in potassium content have been found
in persons suffering from muscle diseases or malfunctions.
For example, a sharp drop in potassium content accompanies
the profound muscle weakness that follows diabetic
coma. Administration of potassium produces striking improvement
in the condition known as familial periodic
paralysis.</p>
<p>Whole body counter data from a study of muscular dystrophy
and myotonia atrophica patients showed there is a
gradual and progressive decrease of body potassium during
the unrelenting courses of these diseases. Otherwise healthy
children of muscular dystrophy patients, or their brothers
and sisters, also may be deficient in potassium. By assisting
in muscle research, whole body counters help doctors
learn more of how potassium relates to muscle function and
muscle health.</p>
<p>Whole body counting is an improvement over potassium
determination based on chemical analysis of body fluids.
If counters are not used, one way to measure body potassium
is to inject a known quantity of potassium-42 (another
radioactive form of potassium), wait until this has been
uniformly mixed with the potassium already in the body,
and then record the radioactivity of a volume of blood serum.
From the degree of dilution of the injected potassium-42,
the total body potassium can be calculated. This widely
used method is uncomfortable for the patient since it involves
use of syringes to inject and withdraw fluids. Because
about 95% of the body potassium is inside the cells,
rather than in fluids between the cells, this method may also
be inexact if the mixing process does not continue long
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
enough. (See <i>Radioisotopes in Medicine</i>, another booklet in
this series, for a full discussion of medical treatment
with radioactive materials.)</p>

<h2 id="c5">CRYSTAL COUNTERS</h2>
<p>When we visit a crystal counter, shown under construction
in <a href="#fig_8">Figure 8</a>, walls of battleship steel 6 to 8 inches
thick are the first things we see. Rather than using shielding
only around the detecting instrument, as was done in
the Geneva counter and early versions of the Los Alamos
counter, crystal counters have shielding around the entire
counting room. With this arrangement the instruments are
available for adjustment and servicing.</p>
<p>This type of counter also uses a different detection device:
a solid, rather than a liquid scintillator. A large crystal,
usually of sodium iodide sensitized with thallium, is
used to convert gamma rays to light photons.</p>
<p>Let us return to the shielding problem for a moment.
Tanks of water, bricks, stone, and lead have been tried by
scientists seeking effective, cheap, and convenient shielding.
Some early counters were built deep underground in the hope
of avoiding cosmic radiation. Radioactive elements are so
widely distributed in the rocks, soil, water, and air, however,
that there is no place where background radiation does
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
not exist. Not even the crystals, glass, or metals used in
the detection system are free of radioactivity.</p>
<p>Pre-World War II surplus armor plate came to be the
preferred shielding material. Thick slabs of battleship steel
were available after the war at low cost. Furthermore,
steel produced since the war may contain unwanted radioactivity
originating in fallout from nuclear tests and make
it undesirable for shielding. Sometimes cobalt-60 used as
a tracer to measure deterioration of blast furnace walls
causes problems in postwar steel, too, so old warship
armor is used when possible.</p>
<p>Some whole body counters have additional shielding. In
the counter at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton,
New York, the steel room is lined with &frac14;-inch lead sheets,
covered by thin layers of cadmium and copper. The lead
is intended to absorb the secondary X rays produced in the
iron by the interaction of high-energy gamma and cosmic
rays. The cadmium and copper absorb the secondary radiation
that is similarly produced in the lead.</p>
<p>The doors of these rooms often weigh 6 tons or more. A
special escape hatch was built into the counter room at the
University of California at Los Angeles, to be used if the
main door should be jammed by an earthquake. In newer
whole body counting laboratories, such as the one at the
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., the steel rooms
are concealed in the interior design and are so pleasantly
furnished that the patient scarcely is aware of the thick
walls around him.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_9">
<img src="images/pmg018.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="373" />
<p class="caption small"><b>Figure 9</b> <i>A sodium iodide crystal, right, and a cluster of 7 photomultiplier
tubes that fit under it to record its scintillations.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p><a href="#fig_9">Figure 9</a> shows a sodium iodide crystal used to react
with the gamma rays that traverse it. To the left of the crystal
is a cluster of seven photomultiplier tubes that &ldquo;watch&rdquo;
for the scintillations, convert them to electrical pulses, and
amplify them so they can be sorted, counted, and recorded.
A trace of thallium added to the sodium iodide improves
its scintillation properties.</p>
<p>In addition to being of convenient size and easy to maintain,
crystal detectors have another advantage over liquid
systems. The energy of the incident gamma rays from crystals
is more accurately indicated by the quality of the
flashes of light impinging on the photomultiplier tubes. If
two or more radionuclides are emitting gamma rays, a
crystal detector distinguishes between their energy levels
with much more precision and sensitivity than does a liquid
system. Crystal instruments separate gamma rays differing
by no more than 0.05 Mev.</p>
<p>The energies of the gamma rays emitted by nuclides have
all been determined and are listed in handbooks. A scientist
can thus identify the data delivered by a multichannel
pulse-height analyzer as coming from potassium-40, zinc-65,
or any other nuclide.</p>
<p>Counters using sodium iodide crystals intercept, and
therefore count, a much smaller fraction of the gammas
emitted by the subject&rsquo;s body than liquid systems, but they
also pick up a smaller amount of background. When speed
is important, the liquid counter is more effective, but the
crystal counter is preferred when radionuclides emitting
gammas of nearly the same energies are to be separated
and counted.</p>
<h2 id="c6">THE RADIUM STORY</h2>
<p>Radium-226 in the human body poses unique problems for
whole body counters. People who have accumulated this
nuclide only because of the minute amounts occurring naturally
in food and water have counts of only two or three
disintegrating atoms per second, and this amount cannot
be distinguished from background radiation. Whole body
counters are useful, however, in diagnosing effects in persons
who have been overexposed to radium. These include
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
persons who formerly were employed to paint watch dials
with a luminous paint containing radium. (See table below.)</p>

Swedish Atomic Energy Commission also has studied the
radium-226 detection. He devised a highly accurate whole
body counter with 10 ion chambers arranged around a curved
aluminum bed on which the subject rested. The instrument
was installed below ground to reduce the interference of
background radiation.</p>

<h2 id="c7">A NEW BODY CONTAMINANT</h2>
<p>In 1955, Charles E. Miller and L. D. Marinelli were measuring
human potassium levels with the whole body counter
at the Argonne laboratory. They were puzzled by finding
several people who emitted 0.660-Mev gamma rays. Gamma
rays of this energy, which are emitted by cesium-137,
had not previously been detected in humans. To add to the
perplexity, when the same persons were examined a few
months later, the count of these gamma rays had increased.
The Argonne findings indicated strongly that radiocesium,
which is known to occur in fallout from nuclear explosions,
was finding its way into people&rsquo;s bodies. (See <i>Fallout from

<p>The idea that this nuclide had entered the body with food
later was tested by placing various foods in the whole body
counter. All foods tested were found to contain some
cesium-137, but beef and dairy products had highest levels.
The radiation spectra of persons of the same age but different
diet habits were compared, and correlation was
found between their cesium-137 content and the amount of
dairy products they ate.</p>
<p>In October 1960, Kurt Liden at the University of Lund in
Sweden encountered evidence of the source of cesium-137 in
humans. While he was using the whole body counter at the
University&rsquo;s Radiation Physics Department, Liden found
several Norwegians whose bodies contained quantities of
cesium-137 several times higher than previously recorded.
He substantiated these data by counting 15 additional Norwegians
from Oslo and 6 from Bergen. The Oslo residents
averaged 21 nanocuries (abbreviated nc) of cesium-137
and the Bergen group 60 nc. Swedes averaged only 8 nc.
(A nanocurie is one billionth of a curie, the standard unit
of radioactivity.)</p>
<p>Curiosity regarding these high values in the Norwegians
led him to investigate goat cheese, which Norwegians consume
in larger quantities than Swedes. Goat cheese at that
time showed a high cesium-137 content of 41 nc per kilogram.
In northern Norway, near Bergen, another main food is
reindeer meat, which was found to contain 28 nc of cesium-137
per kilogram, compared to 0.1 nc per kilogram in beef.
These factors indicated that goat cheese and reindeer meat
were responsible for the high cesium-137 count in the
Norwegians.</p>
<p>Investigation of the soil in northern Norway revealed that
it averaged 20 nc of cesium-137 per square meter. Only
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
thin covers of lichens grow in this region, and reindeer
must graze over large areas to obtain sufficient food. It
was obvious that cesium-137 from fallout was collecting on
lichens and then was being concentrated in the bodies of the
reindeer before they were killed for meat.</p>
<p>Similar studies have been conducted by scientists of the
Pacific Northwest Laboratory at Richland, Washington, who
since 1959 have been measuring radioactivity of plants
and animals in Alaska. When they found high levels of
cesium-137 in lichens and caribou, they became interested
in the body burdens of fallout isotopes in the Eskimos.</p>
<p>A portable crystal type of whole body counter was used to
measure the cesium-137 content of Eskimos at five villages.
The Eskimos cooperated willingly; in some communities
nearly everyone accepted the invitation to be counted. This
table presents the results:</p>

Washington, during this period was between 5 and 7 nanocuries.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These data show that the Eskimos who lived inland at
Anaktuvuk and ate heavily of caribou meat carried cesium-137
burdens up to 20 times greater than Eskimos who lived
in the four villages along the coast and had more variety in
their food. (See pages <a href="#Page_18">18</a> and <a href="#Page_19">19</a> for photo story of a
similar project in Finland.)</p>
<h2 id="c8">PROTECTION OF LABORATORY PERSONNEL</h2>
<p>For chemists or others working with arsenic, cyanide,
or other chemical poisons, safety depends on recognizing
the materials and keeping them where they belong. When
accidents do happen and poisons are swallowed or breathed
in, successful treatment requires that someone find out
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
exactly what and how much of the poisonous material was
involved.</p>
<p>In the event of accidents in nuclear laboratories or reactors,
it would be equally essential to identify accurately
and quickly the quantity and kind of unstable nuclides the
victim has absorbed. A reactor accident conceivably could
add a unique hazard since neutron radiation might change
the normally stable, nonradioactive atoms in the bodies of
nearby workers into radioactive ones. Even gold or silver
fillings in their teeth might become radioactive.</p>

</div>
<p>When human tissue (for example, hair) is bombarded
by fast neutrons, sulfur atoms in molecules of proteins are
converted to the radionuclide phosphorus-32. In atomic
shorthand, this reaction is:</p>
<p class="center">&sup3;&sup2;&#8321;&#8326;S + &sup1;&#8320;n &rarr; &sup3;&sup2;&#8321;&#8325;P + &sup1;&#8321;p</p>
<p>or, in still more abbreviated form, &sup3;&sup2;S<sub>n,p</sub>&sup3;&sup2;P. Phosphorus-32
atoms do not emit gamma rays upon disintegration and so
are not detected in standard whole body counters. Attempts
are being made, however, to adapt some whole body counters
to pick up the secondary radiations, called bremsstrahlung,
that occur when the high-energy beta particles that are
emitted by phosphorus-32 collide with other atoms.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Similarly, neutron bombardment of natural sodium (&sup2;&sup3;Na)
atoms in the body produces sodium-24. This reaction is
written: &sup2;&sup3;Na(n, gamma ray)&sup2;&#8308;Na. The 1.38-Mev gamma rays
emitted by sodium-24 are detected effectively by whole
body counters. Since a given neutron dose converts a known
proportion of &sup2;&sup3;Na atoms to &sup2;&#8308;Na, it is possible to determine
how much neutron exposure a worker has received by obtaining
his body count of radioactive sodium.</p>
<p>Crystal type counters also were used in an interesting
special case of excessive radiation exposure. Seven natives
of the Marshall Islands were examined by the whole body
counter at the Argonne National Laboratory in 1957. Another
whole body counter, mounted in a Navy amphibious landing
ship, was taken to Rongelap Atoll in the Marshalls several
times to check on the health of all the residents of the atoll.
These people had accumulated zinc-65 in their bodies as a
result of contamination of crabs and other food items by
fallout from the March 1954 atomic bomb tests at the
Pacific Proving Ground. Although normal radioactive decay
progressively reduced the total amount of radioactivity in
the area, the Marshallese still were carrying this nuclide
in their bodies after several years. (See <i>Atoms, Nature,
and Man</i>, another booklet in this series, for a more complete
report of this study.)</p>
<h2 id="c9">SPECIAL USES</h2>
<h3>Studies of New Babies</h3>
<p>Study of the transfer of nutrients and other substances
from an expectant mother&rsquo;s body to that of her unborn child
is one of the most challenging areas of biological research.
A team of scientists headed by N. S. MacDonald has used a
whole body counter at the University of California at Los
Angeles to study one aspect of this problem by comparing
the concentrations of radioactive materials in newborn
infants, in babies who are born dead, and in tissues of the
mothers-to-be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>In these studies the scintillation crystal was placed directly
beneath a plastic bassinet holding the babies. Twenty-eight
infants, 6 to 24 hours old, were counted for 45 minutes
each. The only radionuclide found was the ever-present
potassium-40.</p>
<p>The bodies of seven stillborn babies were counted for at
least 10 hours each. More kinds of radionuclides were found
than in the living babies, although the large counting time
may have affected the results.</p>
<p>The same counting techniques were used with placental
tissues from mothers of three of the stillborns. The placenta
is the organ that nourishes an unborn child and through
which substances from the mother&rsquo;s bloodstream are exchanged
with those in the baby&rsquo;s blood. The graphs in <a href="#fig_17">Figure 17</a>
show data from this experiment and illustrate the
method of interpreting whole body counter data. When the
counts per minute at each band of gamma-ray energy recorded
from the placental tissues (b) were subtracted from
corresponding values from the stillborns (a), it was found
(c) that the placentas contained more of the isotopes
ruthenium-103, ruthenium-106, and zirconium-95 than did
the babies that had been nurtured by these placentas. The
babies&rsquo; bodies contained more niobium-95 and potassium-40
than the placentas. Niobium-95 is produced by the radioactive
disintegration of zirconium-95. This suggested that
zirconium-95 atoms do not pass readily through the placenta,
but, after they have decayed to niobium-95, they pass into
the baby&rsquo;s bloodstream easily.</p>
<p>Actually, the gamma-ray energies of zirconium-95 and
niobium-95 are so similar that the counter cannot distinguish
between them. The two isotopes, however, were separated
chemically, and whole body spectra were prepared from
samples of the pure elements. The spectrum (d) of pure
zirconium-95 subtracted from that of pure niobium-95 was
strikingly similar to the spectrum of &ldquo;stillborn baby minus
placenta&rdquo; on the graphs. Cesium-137 was added to the synthetic
spectrum to provide a reference mark at the 0.660-Mev
point. This revealed that the ratio of cesium-137 to
potassium-40 is lower in babies than in adults.</p>

<h3>Research on Body Processes</h3>
<p>Radioactive tracer atoms, either natural or purposefully
built into molecules of vital materials like proteins, are
revealing how these substances function in the body to produce
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
energy or to form new tissues. When we know accurately
the normal totals and kinds of radioactive substances
in the body, we can undertake new kinds of tracer studies
without using large amounts of additional radiation. Small
instruments called scanners (see <a href="#fig_18">Figure 18</a>) usually are used
to track tracer isotopes, but whole body counters are useful
in special circumstances.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig_18">

<p class="caption small"><b>Figure 18</b> <i>A multidetector positron scanner to record radiations with opposed pairs of detection crystals. Scanning devices are commonly used for noting the fate of tracer isotopes in medical diagnosis.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Two types of adaptations enable whole body counters to
locate accumulations of radioactive materials in specific
organs or small portions of the body. At the National Institutes
of Health, Bethesda, Md., one counter is fitted with
three rows of six 12-by-12-inch plastic blocks. Each block
has four photomultiplier tubes to collect the scintillations
from the crystal. The rows are curved so as to be equally
distant from the patient&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>The current pulses from each of the 18 blocks can be fed
individually into the pulse sorter, counter, and recorder.
Thus the kinds and numbers of gamma rays from the sector
of the patient adjacent to any block can be studied individually.
Similarly, the path and speed of the administered materials
can be followed by taking recordings from the blocks
sequentially.</p>
<p>At the U. S. Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Md., a whole
body counter is fitted with a crystal that can be moved at
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
controlled speed past the body of the person being studied
(<a href="#fig_19">Figure 19</a>). To increase its scanning efficiency, the crystal
is fitted with a slit and a focusing device. Instruments
record the body radioactivity visibly at timed intervals as
the crystal moves along the patient&rsquo;s body. A television
screen enables the operator to observe the patient during
the counting.</p>

</div>
<p>The role of iron in preventing one form of anemia has
been clarified by using iron-59 as a tracer. Persons suffering
from chronic infections or such blood diseases as leukemia
and polycythemia vera have been checked for the
amount of iron carried by their red blood cells. Cobalt-60
atoms have been substituted for stable cobalt in molecules
of vitamin B-12 so that the way the body makes use of this
vitamin can be studied. Similarly, the body&rsquo;s use of sodium
can be studied by labeling sodium chloride with sodium-22
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
and then administering solutions of the tagged salt orally
or by injection.</p>
<p>Whole body counters used in tracer studies cause a minimum
of inconvenience for the patient. Their sensitivity
permits use of smaller quantities of radioactive material
than is required with small scanning instruments.</p>
<p>Those are unusual jobs for whole body counters, however.
Scanners or other types of instruments are used more typically
in following tracer isotopes.</p>

<p class="caption small"><b>Figure 20</b> <i>Dogs about to be examined in a whole body counter.</i></p>
</div>
<p>How do dogs accumulate fallout isotopes in their bodies?
This question was answered effectively by placing dogs in
whole body counters and comparing the count from radioactive
strontium-emitted gamma rays originating in their
bodies with the count from a masonite phantom dog containing
a known amount of radioactive strontium-85. It was
found that female dogs increase their strontium retention
while they are nursing newborn puppies. Strontium is much
like calcium, which is a major component of milk. One dog
measured had broken a leg in a fight. The counter showed
above-average strontium accumulation for this dog, and it
was conjectured that strontium, a &ldquo;bone-seeking&rdquo; element,
had followed calcium to the point of bone repair and new
bone growth.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_22">Figure 22</a> shows how animals differ in their retention of
orally administered zinc-65, as revealed by a whole body
counter. It is apparent that counters can be used to determine
the differences in the metabolism of different animal
species used for research. Standard data developed in this
way can serve to reduce error that may occur if results
from one species are used for interpretation of data for
another species, such as man.</p>
<p>A University of Illinois project to breed meat animals
with a high lean-to-fat ratio has been aided by whole body
counters. The tendency to deposit fat seems to be inherited,
and breeding stock with low fat content can be selected,
using &ldquo;muscle-seeking&rdquo; potassium-40 to show the proportion
of muscle in each potential parent. The Illinois counter
is unique in being large enough to examine an adult steer
(<a href="#fig_23">Figure 23</a>). A similar counter at Cornell University has
been used to study animals infested with internal parasites,
comparing them with parasite-free animals. The counter
revealed that a positive relationship exists between the
level of parasite infestation and loss of iron-59-labeled
blood from the digestive tract. The possibility of using this
method to evaluate parasite-killing drugs is being considered.
The Cornell counter is kept clean by covering
the animals with plastic sheeting. The same counter also
can serve human patients, who are positioned in a wheeled
hospital stretcher. (See <a href="#fig_1D">Figure 1D</a>.)</p>
<h2 id="c10">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>This booklet has presented a sample of the ways whole
body counters add to man&rsquo;s knowledge and increase his
ability to manage conditions and processes important to his
health and well-being. Radioactive substances occur naturally
within our own bodies and all other materials. Whole
body counters measure this radioactivity, or any which may
have been added from artificial sources.</p>
<p>We have seen how these sensitive instruments help to prove
hypotheses difficult to verify otherwise and how they thereby
may stimulate new and fruitful scientific experimentation.
We have learned how whole body counters add to our knowledge
of normal processes in healthy bodies and detect disease
or abnormalities resulting from dangerous conditions.</p>

are shown, a description of a photomultiplier is given, and the
pulse-height analyzer principle is illustrated.</p>
<p><i>Human Radioactivity Measurements</i>, 9 minutes, color and sound,
1958. Produced by AEC&rsquo;s Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory.
This film shows a method developed at LASL to monitor possible
intake of radiation by personnel. The liquid scintillation counter
is large enough to contain a man and sensitive enough to detect
even the minute amounts of his natural gamma radioactivity.</p>
<p><i>Ionizing Radiation in Humans</i>, 15 minutes, color and sound, 1958.
Produced by AEC&rsquo;s Argonne National Laboratory. Describes the
design and operation of ANL&rsquo;s whole body counter for determining
identification, quantity, and location of internally deposited
radioelements. Various techniques in accumulation of data are
shown.</p>
<p><i>Liquid Scintillation Counting</i>, 14 minutes, color and sound, 1958.
Produced by the Jam Handy Organization for the U. S. Atomic
Energy Commission. Describes the use of a liquid scintillator
for counting low-energy beta emitters commonly used in biological
and medical tracer experiments. Also describes counting
techniques, how the counters work, and how a sample is prepared.</p>
